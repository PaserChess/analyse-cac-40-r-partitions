That project was created as a way to find where to invest in the CAC 40, for particular french investors or non-french wishing to diversify their investments, buying only once in the year. 
Lots of backtests were made on the 2010-2020 period trying to find the best parameters for the length of data needed, 
the most appropriated model (Markowitz, Black-Litterman, Black-Litterman with single index model for the covariance matrix,...), 
the best parameters for the machine learning engine, the maximum and minimum weight to put on each asset, the ideal tau for the BL model, and multiple other parameters that had to be backtested in the right order and compared
The results of the strategy for the 2021-2025 period are available on the graphic of the same name, it shows a growth from 100€ to 346€ in 5 years while the benchmark (the cac 40) grew from 100€ to 142€.
The results indicated that, as of january-february of 2026, with a very agressive strategy, Engie and Orange are the companies with the best potential for the year 2026, and the best decision is to invest 50% of one's portfolio in each asset.
